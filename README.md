# Overview of the Election Audit
<!-- Explain the purpose of this analysis. -->
We were tasked with helping the Colorado Board of Elections team, with automating the process to audit the congressional election. They have always used excel for this process, but have tasked us to create a Python script/program which complete a number of functions.

- This program will do the following:

  1. Tabulate the number of votes cast total.
  2. Determine the number and percent of votes cast for each county.
  3. Find the county with the largest turnout.
  4. find number and percent of votes cast for each candidate.
  5. Declare the winner of the Election for the congressional district, specifically labeling the number and percent of the votes.
